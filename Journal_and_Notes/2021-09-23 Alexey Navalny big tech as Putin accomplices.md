Alexey Navalny (@navalny): Thread.

(1/14) If something surprised me in the latest elections, it was not how Putin forged the results, but how obediently the almighty Big Tech turned into his accomplices.

(2/14) The giants Apple @Apple and Google @Google have complied with the Kremlin's demands and removed our app from their stores. My beloved YouTube has deleted our video, and the Telegram messenger has blocked our bot.

(3/14) These programs, which Putin calls "extremist", only contained information about opposition candidates in your constituency.

(4/14) By law and common sense, each of us has the right to campaign for voting (or not voting) for any candidate.

(5/14) In our case, the very intention to organize voters in order to put competitive pressure on the ruling party was declared criminal, and Big Tech agreed with this.

(6/14) This means that it recognizes the right of an authoritarian thief to subjugate the Internet, turning it into an instrument for seizure of power.

(7/14) It's one thing when the Internet monopolists are ruled by cute freedom-loving nerds with solid life principles.

(8/14) It is completely different when the people in charge of them are both cowardly and greedy.

(9/14) One of the modern challenges is that false prophets now come to us not in sheep's clothing, but in hoodies and stretched jeans. Standing in front of the huge screens, they tell us about "making the world a better place", but on the inside they are liars and hypocrites.

(10/14) The media write that the Kremlin forced Big Tech to make concessions by showing them a list of their employees to be arrested. If so, then keeping silent about it is the worst crime. This is encouragement of a hostage-taking terrorist.

(11/14) I know that most of those who work at Google, Apple, etc. are honest and good people. I urge them not to put up with the cowardice of their bosses.

(12/14) I can't help but say that I am terribly upset and disappointed with Pavel Durov @durov from Telegram. I didn't expect to see him on the list of Putin's "blockers".

(13/14) Not too long ago, I spoke at a rally against the Kremlin's blocking of Telegram itself.

(14/14) And I would have done it again, by the way. The fact that someone betrays their principles does not mean that we should doubt ours.

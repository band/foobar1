# 2022-06-26 Imani Barbarin get to know your community

Imani Barbarin, MAGC | Crutches&Spice ♿️ (@Imani_Barbarin): There’s a reason that People aren’t sharing local community organizations and funds you should be working with:

YOURE THE ONE WHO HAS TO GET TO KNOW YOUR COMMUNITY. 

Why is that so hard to grasp. You have to do the work. You have to connect with people.

That’s the whole point.

It’s remarkable how you all will try to avoid that responsibility at every turn. 

It’s probably because it means you’ll have to go against your nature as WP: you’ll actually have to eschew your individualism, you’ll have to decanter yourselves, you’ll have to sacrifice

For those outside of yourselves, you’ll have to be real uncomfortable in your own privilege and learn to use it for good. 

Every aspect to how you’ve been socialized has sheltered you from any responsibility in this, which is why you’re here now. 

Your time to whine, whimper

And flail was decades ago, we don’t have time for the weaponized incompetence and we sure as shot don’t have the energy to endure the racist, sexist, ableist, and transphobic gaslighting. 

You want to move forward, you acknowledge every part of us, because our

Expertise was formed because of the pieces you want to ignore. You don’t get to erase them. 

The choice is yours, but don’t expect people to wait for you.

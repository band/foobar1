### Chapter 1 Demonized Politics

- Page 30 · Location 358

It's the decision of the traditionally white and male establishment
leaders to invest in white voters versus the Democratic voters of the
future, which they shy away from, so they can pretend we still live in
the status quo. We don't live there anymore, and we shouldn't be
afraid of the future.

### Chapter 2 Bernie Bros Exist and So Does White Privilege

- Page 42 · Location 458

Caged children aren't concerned with the nuance of Wall Street
regulation, but people are suffering because the Bernie or bust set
wasn't able to see past their own preferences and prejudices.

- Page 45 · Location 495

in some ways, the supporters of Trump and the Bernie Bros are
responding to the same perceived loss of privileges --- privileges that
they have been afforded for generations.

### Chapter 3 The White Resistance 

- Page 49 · Location 514

WHEN YOU'RE ACCUSTOMED to privilege, equality feels like oppression.

- Page 53 · Location 571

We're not unique in our evils ... I think where we may be singular is
our refusal to acknowledge them, and the legends and myths we tell
about our inherent goodness to hide, and cover, and conceal, so that
we can maintain a kind of willful ignorance that protects our innocence.

Moderation is outdated for our times and our intractable problems, and
this rush to the Democratic center is futile at best.

### Chapter 6 The Hashtag Kids 

- Page 137 · Location 1532

I don't need you \[ Biden \] to work with Republicans. I need you to
push the Republicans out and I need you to vigorously fight for an
agenda that will actually do something for me, because working with the
Republicans means you're working with people who are trying to destroy
my ability to thrive . ... You're talking about working with the
people who are trying to take away my health care, with the people who
make these sexist and racist remarks all the time, the people who are
basically responsible for all this gun violence ... when you think
about the issues that are at the forefront, particularly in the black
community, and working people ... the Republican agenda is the opposite.

### Chapter 7 The Blue Wave Is Not Uncle Joe 

- Page 168 · Location 1884

We need a bolder vision than looking back because there is no time in
the past where women and people of color collectively have had more
power than we do right now.

- Page 168 · Location 1889

We want to progress toward a more equitable future. We want a future
that radically reimagines American society, a future that requires a
leader to speak truth to power about the present and past with an actual
understanding of the cost of a gallon of milk in our neighborhoods ---
and whether or not that's even affordable .

white Americans have had over a three-hundred-year head start in
this country, so it's time for everyone else to catch up. And the
starting line is the ballot box.

### Chapter 8 The Billionaire Boys' Club 

- Page 176 · Location 1945

And while income inequality itself is colorblind, the effect of
historically classist and racist structures -- such as gerrymandering
and redlining -- have left generations a lap behind their fellow
Americans.

(I do not understand how \"income inequality\" is colorblind. Maybe ZM
means the class distinction is more important? This sentence seems out
of tune with the themes in this essay. \[WLA\])

### Conclusion: The Path Forward 

- Page 200 · Location 2219

American voters must reflect on why diversity was whittled down in favor
of stale pale male politics. As feminist writer Lauren Duca wrote after
the last viable woman candidate, Senator Elizabeth Warren, exited the
race: "I'm afraid it's too late to ask to un-see The Matrix now.
America is an oligarchy ruled by the hierarchy of the white supremacist
patriarchy, and we must each commit to a habit of political action,
out of duty to ourselves and each other. At any given moment, you're
either actively fighting for equality, or you're complicit in the
system of oppression that prevents it."

The end of white politics post-Trump has to be an intentional act by
the Democratic Party. It has to be an intentional movement to see
people of color as powerful and essential components of a winning
progressive coalition.

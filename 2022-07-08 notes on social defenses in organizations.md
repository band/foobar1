# 2022-07-08 notes on social defenses in organizations

notes from [[James Krantz 2010 Social Defenses and 21st Century Organizations]] the following excerpts and notes:
 - "social systems function as a defense against persecutory and depressive anxiety"
	 - persecutory anxiety:
	 - depressive anxiety:
/ these anxieties are ever-present //
/ as individuals we learn to manage and cope with these feelings //
"... in organizations the structures and practices of decision-making, and the divisions of authority and labor, etc. are the "stuff" of social defenses. While these aspects of organizational life exist to facilitate work, they come to be utilized for the additional purpose of helping people manage anxiety. (Krantz, p. 2)

Ben See (@ClimateBen): BREAKING: UN Secretary General says many of Earth's ecosystems "are at the point of no return NOW" ðŸ§µ

Ben See (@ClimateBen): 1. Economic growth is taking us to 1.6-2.4Â°C by 2050. 

"places where people live and work may cease to exist.. ecosystems and species that we've all grown up with and that are central to our cultures and inform our languages may disappear"

See video clip:https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-60525591

Ben See (@ClimateBen): 2. Ecosystem collapse is caused by so many elements of today's destructive growth economy. It's not just abrupt climate change.

We can act to protect species and everybody, but it will take profound system change.

We must focus on this.

Media?

Silent. https://twitter.com/ClimateBen/status/1476268007290773510?s=20&t=k43A1Q1imTmOhrUYAr5jFQ

Ben See (@ClimateBen): 3. Economic growth is taking us deeper and deeper into mass extinction. Deforestation, logging, road-building, plastic & chemical & light & noise pollution, pesticides, mining, deep sea trawling, industrial agriculture, construction,... 

Not just climate:

Ben See (@ClimateBen): 4. We must re-organise the way we live. We must rethink energy. 

Media systems are not providing/supporting an adequate discourse around how we can best act on this predicament. Profound change, not 'green' growth and 100s of millions of electric cars..

Source article: Larry Hirschhorn, Extending the Tavistork model: bringing desire, danger, dread, and excitement into a theory of organizational process. _Organisational & Social Dynamics_ 21(1) 114-133 (2021) <https://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/phoenix/osd/2021/00000021/00000001/art00009>

(p. 114) Tavistock model central focus: the actual work that groups and organizations must accomplish to survive and succeed.

(p. 115) how the psychodynamics of organizations shapes strategic choice and developmental change
- how anxiety shapes our core understanding of organizational psychodynamics  
- how open systems theory provides a model of a well-functioning organization in which anxiety is contained. 
- how sociotechnical system thinking amplifies well-functioning by considering issues of alienation and work satisfaction  
- in satisfying work environs desire stimulates an abstract future, and also creates feelings of excitement, danger, and dread, as well as a contest for authority. 
- how desire and the link to new primary task(s) stimulate politics and an experience of primary risk  
- the idea of developmental defences and structures - and a next step for psychoanalytic informed theory of organizational development. 

The presenting question becomes: can organizations tolerate the friction sufficiently in order to take advantage of desire and its consequences?

Asheesh (@AsheeshKSi): A must read story that highlights the institutional violence of the financialized university https://twitter.com/NewYorker/status/1420117301198823429

Asheesh (@AsheeshKSi): I would strongly urge anyone contemplating grad school or an academic career to read and reflect on this piece. And those of us in the academy need to think about how to change the incredibly reactionary, racist institutional environment described.

Asheesh (@AsheeshKSi): Final point about this piece for right now: the depiction of @HarvardUniv's governing culture is indisputable proof that the university is a right-wing institution, not a left-wing radical one. Harvard is Trumpian in its contempt for democratic processes. https://twitter.com/AsheeshKSi/status/1420151661004304385/photo/1

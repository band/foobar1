Perhaps because I am retired from full-time employment I am resistant to the focus on people cataloging their skills, passions, superpowers, etc. This seems to be one sure way for me to "raise shields" and proceed with caution.

1. Stop asking people "What is your superpower?" when they are new to a group or activity.  
2. Ditto for the "What is your passion?" question. Especially in a job or work interview.

Reading today (where was that?) I came across (once again) the admonishment I read as when I have figured out my understanding of some society shared question or issue I am obliged to share it. My heretical response to this is: I am not obliged to share what I learn, comprehend, or discover.

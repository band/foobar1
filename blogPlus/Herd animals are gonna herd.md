## Humans are herd animals, in person and online

We may have left the 20th century hierarchical organization behind, but our psychodynamics are still with us. Collaborative working in collectives and networked arrangements provide new ways of accomplishing tasks, but also provide social defenses against our psychotic anxieties. New group structures eschew formal hierarchy, and work and employment arrangements seem more precarious, resulting in a general uncertainty about the future(s). Precarity is not our friend -- we need to manage the feelings and anxieties stimulated in the groups or behind the scenes.

Psycho-social analysis of these group work organizations and behaviors can reveal maladaptive behaviors and promote group learning and productive adaptation.

Well that's a lot to take in.

Installed Obsidian Git; now what?
- prolly need to set up credentials for github access

2021-02-28
Deleted Obsidian Git
- rebooted machine
- interested to see what happens with Git credentials

- re-installed Obsidian Git
   but I still do not see how to set up anything; like, where are the settings?
   
   - OK, so i need to actually turn it on (doh!)
   - and it says "git:ready" in the bottom bar

 - now what?

 - OK, once enabled I found the setup options. So let us see what happens. (Maybe restart Obsidian first?)
 - Yay! that all worked. And seems to work.

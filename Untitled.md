Writing well without getting stuck

Here's a theory of creativity that will instantly make you a better writer:

When people say, “writing is thinking,” 99% don’t mean it literally.

They mean it figuratively: writing clarifies thinking by helping put ideas in order.

But they were right the first time: writing doesn’t clarify thinking; writing IS thinking.

Writing and conscious thinking are one and the same thing.

When you write, you’re not “putting your thoughts in writing” or “conveying your ideas.”

Your thoughts are the writing itself.

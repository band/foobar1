Michael Ross (@MichaelRoss7): What can we learn about climate politics from the (long overdue) passage of the Inflation Reduction Act?

Two things:

1. Economists were wrong
2. Political scientists were right

A üßµ

Michael Ross (@MichaelRoss7): Economists have long urged governments to adopt carbon taxes or cap-and-trade systems as a 'first best' policy. The idea of carbon pricing has dominated debates about climate policy -- in the US and globally -- for 3 decades.

Michael Ross (@MichaelRoss7): But a small group of (mostly) political scientists pushed back. They have made 3 arguments.

1. Climate politics is not about "getting prices right" or "optimizing policies." It's a distributive conflict between the allies of #fossilfuels and the backers of green energy. https://twitter.com/MichaelRoss7/status/1557556580207378432/photo/1

Michael Ross (@MichaelRoss7): Key studies include Breetz, Mildenberger, and Stokes (2018) "Political logics of clean energy transitions" in B&P @leahstokes @mmildenberger @HannaBreetz  https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/business-and-politics/article/political-logics-of-clean-energy-transitions/3EBB1887089929B48CD623309C6751A9

Michael Ross (@MichaelRoss7): And Colgan, Green and Hale (2020), "Asset revaluation and the existential politics of climate change"  @IntOrgJournal @JeffDColgan @greenprofgreen @thomasnhale  https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/international-organization/article/asset-revaluation-and-the-existential-politics-of-climate-change/0963988860A37F6988E73738EA93E0A1

Michael Ross (@MichaelRoss7): 2. Carbon pricing is politically unpopular and often fails. Prophetic studies include Jenkins (2014), "Political economy constraints on carbon pricing policies," in Energy Policy @JesseJenkins  https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0301421514000901

Michael Ross (@MichaelRoss7): Cullenward and Victor's 2020 book, Making climate policy work @dcullenward https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Making+Climate+Policy+Work-p-9781509541805

Michael Ross (@MichaelRoss7): And Green (2021), "Does carbon pricing reduce emissions? A review of ex-post analyses" in Environmental Research Letters https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/abdae9/meta

Michael Ross (@MichaelRoss7): 3. Climate policies should instead be reframed as green industrial policy, not "saving the planet" or "getting prices right." Use carrots, not sticks.

Meckling, Kelsey, Biber and Zysman (2015), "Winning coalitions for climate policy" @jonasmeckling  https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/science.aab1336?casa_token=nmE5qtzCBk4AAAAA:RQ42TRd0bjdy2LIXheiWOqKtlMHBhxaSamfXpqcUCn3QprmJYGevngGWoaY8oKq-UkyFuwBiF54

Michael Ross (@MichaelRoss7): And Dani Rodrik (2014), "Green Industrial Policy" in Oxford Review of Economic Policy (a dissident economist!) https://academic.oup.com/oxrep/article-abstract/30/3/469/549542

Michael Ross (@MichaelRoss7): After decades of clamor from economists about carbon pricing, these scholars quietly built the intellectual foundation for this landmark bill and deserve recognition!

Michael Ross (@MichaelRoss7): None of these studies were published in top political science journals üßê and many were overlooked when first published

Michael Ross (@MichaelRoss7): My list is radically incomplete! Many others have developed these arguments, too -- please add your favorites in the replies.

# eco-modernism defense WTFIT?

Dr. Genevieve Guenther (@DoctorVive): A short üßµshowing how Steven Pinker's @sapinker defense of ecomodernism is built on climate denial.

Step 1: Pinker avers that ecomodernists realize that "industrialization has been good for humanity," & he footnotes his claim.

Step 2: In the footnote, he cites HIMSELF (previous chapters of the very same book!), and someone named "Epstein." https://twitter.com/DoctorVive/status/1548728118160101376/photo/1

Step 3: In the bibliography (layers and layers later) Pinker provides his real reference‚Äî"The Moral Case for Fossil Fuels." 

Et voil√†! Pinkers' defense of ecomodernism rests on climate denial.

I will be taking no questions at this time. üòÅ

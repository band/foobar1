# SW Heritage

Colin Gordon csgordon@types.pl (@csgordon): As a 3x artifact evaluation chair, again, git repositories on reliable commercial hosting sites are *not* archival. Deletion is only one of many reasons. See also Google Code, and Bitbucket deleting all mercurial repos. This happens somewhere every ~5 years. https://twitter.com/TheRegister/status/1555241607628083201

Roberto Di Cosmo (@rdicosmo): @csgordon This is one of the reasons we started @SWHeritage many years ago: archive and reference #software #sourcecode with its development history for the long term. We should all use it for #research software, and in #AECs ðŸ‘‰ https://www.softwareheritage.org/howto-archive-and-reference-your-code/ 1/3

Roberto Di Cosmo (@rdicosmo): @csgordon @SWHeritage 2/3 Today, you can trigger archival of software you care about in just one click, using dedicated browser extensions ðŸ‘‰https://www.softwareheritage.org/browser-extensions/
And you can cite software with the biblatex-software package from CTAN ðŸ‘‰https://www.softwareheritage.org/2020/05/26/citing-software-with-style/ Now included in the #ACM LaTeX package!

Roberto Di Cosmo (@rdicosmo): @csgordon @SWHeritage 3/3 We saved ~1M projects from gitorious, google code, and bitbucket, see ðŸ‘‰ "Discontinued hosting" on https://archive.softwareheritage.org/.
Will do http://gitlab.com too. May you help getting researchers to use @SWHeritage without waiting for crisis like this?

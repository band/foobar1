## 2021-04-09 personal massive wiki learnings

1. Finally have a roadmap to gather my web content here and publish with a Massive Wiki front-end.
2. Web-facing content of GitHub repos is in the "About" blurb.
3. Next steps include
	- bringing Tumblr content over
	- getting the web-facing MW working

4. build the MW using MWB
     - all work done in the .massivewikibuilder/ directory
	 - $ python3 -m venv venv

5. keep Obsidian setup and settings separate from the content of the massive wiki repository
	- copied contents of .obsidian directory to my own version controlled directory 'obsidianSettings'
	- this adds a copy step when setting up a new vault (and assumes that I want the same Osbidian settings in every vault)

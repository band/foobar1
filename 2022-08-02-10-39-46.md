Dr. Genevieve Guenther (@DoctorVive): The idea that we can "overshoot" 1.5 C and then reverse ecological damage later with carbon dioxide removal is not empirical science, but capitalist ideology, which claims, falsely, that any negative externality of growth is temporary and can be overcome by innovation.

Dr. Genevieve Guenther (@DoctorVive): Or maybe the claim that externalities can be overcome by innovation is true, but the reality is that a functioning planetary ecosystem is not an "externality," but the very pre-requisite of scientific and economic activity.

# 2022-05-07 Jiddu Krishnamurti

>The core of Krishnamurti’s teaching is contained in the statement he made in 1929 when he said, “Truth is a pathless land.” Man cannot come to it through any organization, through any creed, through any dogma, priest or ritual, not through any philosophical knowledge or psychological technique. He has to find it through the mirror of relationship, through the understanding of the contents of his own mind, through observation and not through intellectual analysis or introspective dissection.—J. Krishnamurti, _The Core of the Teachings_

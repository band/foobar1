## testing the github connection

I think I just lost the nice steps outlined in the blank note about interacting with Github. Interacting with these newer document engineering tools is sometimes just plain odd.

But let's see if we can post this to Github.

 - pushing from hackmd just overwrote the existing file; so that's a
   breakdown in work steps
   - cannot create new files on hackmd? file needs to be already in
     the Git repo prior to push? WTF?
	 
#### here is what was in this file prior to the hackmd test
2021-02-26

1. successful setup of a second vault
2. this vault is also a git repository
3. next step: connect the two

2021-03-01

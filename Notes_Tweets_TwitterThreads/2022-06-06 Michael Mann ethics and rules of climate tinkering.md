w/ comments from me and others (a thread) ðŸ§µ

Prof Michael E. Mann (@MichaelEMann): Here are my detailed responses to various questions about the proposed "ethical framework" which provides fuller context for the short quotes/paraphrases of me in the article.

Prof Michael E. Mann (@MichaelEMann): 1. Is this necessary and why or why not?
2. Do you think an ethical framework will encourage, discourage hasten, or slow climate intervention and why or why not?

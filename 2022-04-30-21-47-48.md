Timnit Gebru (@timnitGebru): How can we let it be known far & wide that there's a religion in Silicon Valley (longtermism/effective altruism & similar) that has convinced itself that the best thing to do for "all of humanity" is to throw as much money as possible to the problem of "AGI"...

Alexander Guerrero (@Alex_A_Guerrero): @timnitGebru A book needs to be written. There is serious philosophical thought behind EA & longtermism and that needs to be engaged. But there is also an ideological and sociological story to be told about why those ideas have been embraced as they have by the ultrawealthy in Silicon Valley.

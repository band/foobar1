NickðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡º (@nicktolhurst): +UPDATE+

For the 1st time since 1950, Britain is no longer a top 10 trading partner of Germany.

Britain has now become a 2nd league trade partner to Germany - one of the worldâ€™s leading trade nations & the European economic powerhouse.

NickðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡º (@nicktolhurst): Whatâ€™s interesting about this is that German exports to UK are holding up but UK exports to Germany are sinking. https://twitter.com/nicktolhurst/status/1435862308299972609/photo/1

Leslie Philibert (@PhilibertLeslie): @nicktolhurst Notice that here in Germany Brexit is no longer much of a subject of great concern, big issues are the election, Covid, Afghanistan, the train strike. Some Brexit politicians imagine that Europe is constantly preoccupied with Britain. Not true. A non member state..

Alexander Kaufman (@AlexCKaufman): Boston is considering banning gas-powered lawn mowers and leaf blowers. 30 minutes of a gas-power leaf blower produce as much air pollution as driving a Ford F-150 from Texas to Alaska. 1 hour produces smog-forming pollution equal to driving 1,100 miles. https://www.universalhub.com/2022/councilors-consider-outlawing-gas-powered-leaf

Alexander Kaufman (@AlexCKaufman): (This is a new tweet to correct an earlier version, which cited a stat that referred to CO2. I looked up the original citation from California air regulators and found that, contrary to my last link, was actually smog-forming pollution).

@XrRebel: NEW on our Blog:
Tessa Hadley "Shapes of our fear" on @GhoshAmitav 'The Great Derangement & why "climate catastrophe is difficult for realism, because in our part of the Western world we don’t fully know yet what its catastrophe feels like."

@GhoshAmitav: " If we only look long enough at what’s in front of our eyes, we can learn to see through it." Fine, thoughtful piece that lucidly expresses many of my own perplexities. https://twitter.com/XrRebel/status/1438440038908452865

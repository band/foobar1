# shit-posting redux

Tressie McMillan Cottom (@tressiemcphd): It drives me nuts how much trying to preempt every argument (most of them ill-informed and argued in bad faith) just ruins writing, too. All the hedging and caveats are clunky and un-fun. https://twitter.com/base10/status/1528408006949580802

Like, if you think I am the character youâ€™ve cast me as in your head that needs to defend everything before I utter a single prepositional phrase? Just stop reading me. Iâ€™m tired.

stitch (@stitchmediamix): @tressiemcphd It's so frustrating and then it doesn't even work? So you've frontloaded your argument to account for and head off people who will accuse you of wild nonsense and not only is your work now really difficult to read... But those people just shift to attack you over THAT ðŸ˜«

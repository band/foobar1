Steve Schmidt (@SteveSchmidtSES): Elections have consequences.  2022 should be no different. Presently, the Democratic House Majority is speeding towards a historic defeat that is the result of a profound communications and political failure. The Democratic Party is on track to badly lose to a cabal of

Steve Schmidt (@SteveSchmidtSES): 2/ proven liars, weirdos, petty criminals, militia extremists, religious extremists, racist extremists, fascist extremists, conspiracy theorists and useful idiots in service to the cause of a Russian war criminal. This result is unacceptable and the direct result of a failure to

Steve Schmidt (@SteveSchmidtSES): 3/ overwhelm the meanness, cruelty, indecency, violence, insanity and UN Americanness of the extremist messaging with something, anything, BETTER. Unless this turns around in short order, the consequences for failure should be profound when it comes to 2024. President Biden

Steve Schmidt (@SteveSchmidtSES): 4/ has recently signaled through a series of leaks that he intends to be a candidate in 2024 under the theory that he is the only candidate who can survive a Trump rematch or stave off his successor. Should Kevin McCarthy’s GOP take power, all bets should be off in 2024

Steve Schmidt (@SteveSchmidtSES): 5/ The survival of American democracy will be dependent on the ability to connect and communicate effectively. This means we need a new generation of Presidential candidates. It means people like @MalloryMcMorrow and @jaredpolis should run for President. It means it’s time for

Steve Schmidt (@SteveSchmidtSES): 6/ @ChrisMurphyCT @brianschatz and other rising leaders to say there is no time left to wait. It means that the Senate Democratic Leader has to have the ability to communicate in plain English in a way that makes sense to people. It means that we will need political leaders who

Steve Schmidt (@SteveSchmidtSES): 7/ can unite the American people in the cause of American renewal and the strengthening of our shared Union. The majority of America is against the extremism. The vast majority is being held hostage by a process that has eliminated competition and given an enormous and utterly

Steve Schmidt (@SteveSchmidtSES): 8/ undeserved influence over national affairs to a tiny minority that has infested and strangled  the mechanisms of party politics like Kudzu vines marinated in miracle grow overtaking a city. Simply, there is no excuse for losing to the forces of malice that have so utterly and

Steve Schmidt (@SteveSchmidtSES): 9/ completely revealed themselves. The time to start grappling with the “why are we losing to these people question”
is now, not at the election postmortem conferences. The answers to those questions are plain as day. The tragedy in all of this is that the majority is

Steve Schmidt (@SteveSchmidtSES): losing to a minority who has succeeded in only 1 terrible thing. They have built a durable majority of cynicism that has led people to think that it is all equally terrible and corrupt when in fact that is not true. The country needs leaders who can both tell and sell that truth.

Steve Schmidt (@SteveSchmidtSES): 11/ Politics in a democratic society are messy. Sometimes it can become staggeringly corrupt. Sometimes it can be comically inept. Sometimes dogs get elected Mayor and sometimes they do a good job. Politics in a free society is the vocation of hope and belief that mankind can

Steve Schmidt (@SteveSchmidtSES): 12/ transcend itself to build something better for the people we love who will carry on after us. We are building for the people unborn that will be loved by the people we will never meet who carry our blood and our shared American stories. The work of politics is the work of

Steve Schmidt (@SteveSchmidtSES): 13/ building the “Just Society”. It can be at hand within a human lifetime but the prerequisite to building it is the ability to stop the vandals from burning down the idea. That can only be done with vision and conviction married to action. That is the test over the next 7 mos.

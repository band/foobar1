Martha Crawford (@shrinkthinks): I’m not putting my energies into preparing to survive the collapse of civilization. 

I’m too busy doing what I can trying to alleviate whatever suffering I can now in the world around me.

Martha Crawford (@shrinkthinks): I’d rather spend my finite energies being of use in whatever way I can in the present - 

not preparing for a future I might not live to see anyway. 

There is work to do now.  A world to build, suffering to soothe, skills to transfer, problems to solve.

Martha Crawford (@shrinkthinks): I gave up futurizing  already.  Ambition. Long term goals.  The illusion of any kind of certainty. 

I have no idea what is coming next - and the only way I am preparing for it is trying to share what I can *now*

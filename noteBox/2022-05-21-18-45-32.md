Ida Bae Wells (@nhannahjones): “Black people posed a danger to the country’s idea of itself; they held up a mirror into which the nation preferred not to peer. So the inhumanity visited on Black people by every generation of white America justified the inhumanity of the past and the inequality of the present.”

Shachi Bhatt (she/her) (@heyshachi): @nhannahjones This powerful quote reminds me of Lucille Clifton’s (equally impactful) poem. https://twitter.com/heyshachi/status/1527993333229944833/photo/1

Ida Bae Wells (@nhannahjones): @heyshachi Yes.

Shachi Bhatt (she/her) (@heyshachi): @nhannahjones To anyone interacting with this, here is the poem in the image (my text caption didn’t save, so sorry!)

Title: why some people be mad at me sometimes

Poem:
they ask me to remember
but they want me to remember
their memories
and i keep on remembering
mine.

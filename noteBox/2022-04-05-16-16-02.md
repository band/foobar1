Paul Poast (@ProfPaulPoast): Samuel Huntington deserves some credit: he was right...about when and how his theory would be wrong.

And it is wrong. Let's look closely at what the Ukraine-Russia war means for the "Clash of Civilizations".

Paul Poast (@ProfPaulPoast): The "Clash of Civilizations" refers to a thesis the late political scientist Samuel Huntington put forward in a 1993 @ForeignAffairs piece...

Paul Poast (@ProfPaulPoast): ...and then in a 1996 book.

https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000R1BAH4/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1

Paul Poast (@ProfPaulPoast): In the Foreign Affairs article, Huntington states his argument very clearly: in the post-Cold War world, the dominate sources of conflict will not be ideological or economic, but cultural. https://twitter.com/ProfPaulPoast/status/1510230221286518785/photo/1

Paul Poast (@ProfPaulPoast): "Cultural" can mean a variety of things (we'll come back to that), though he emphasizes religion. https://twitter.com/ProfPaulPoast/status/1510230225921134593/photo/1

Paul Poast (@ProfPaulPoast): That paper went on to have an enormous impact.  

It's been cited a ridiculous number of times... https://twitter.com/ProfPaulPoast/status/1510230230140653568/photo/1

Paul Poast (@ProfPaulPoast): ...and has found it's way (time and again) into foreign policy discourse.

Paul Poast (@ProfPaulPoast): With respect to the current ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦-ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡º  war, Putin has repeatedly invoked the notion of civilization and civilizational struggle as underpinning his broader motivations towards Ukraine. 
https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2020/05/25/putin-and-the-distinct-russian-civilization-a70370

Paul Poast (@ProfPaulPoast): Such discourse has been picked up in analysis of the war.

Paul Poast (@ProfPaulPoast): But here's the thing: if he were alive today, Huntington would have to admit that the war actually UNDERMINES his thesis...and in a crucial way. https://twitter.com/ProfPaulPoast/status/1510230240009887749/photo/1

Paul Poast (@ProfPaulPoast): On the one hand, Huntington wrote that Ukraine sat on a "fault line" between "civilizations" https://twitter.com/ProfPaulPoast/status/1510230245403762694/photo/1

Paul Poast (@ProfPaulPoast): He even provided a map to underline this point. https://twitter.com/ProfPaulPoast/status/1510230250562768900/photo/1

Paul Poast (@ProfPaulPoast): This would seem to suggest that Ukraine would be a source of conflict, right?  

Not so, according to Huntington. This leads to "the other hand".

Paul Poast (@ProfPaulPoast): On the other hand, Huntington explicitly predicts that the probability of conflict will be low "IF CIVILIZATION IS WHAT COUNTS". https://twitter.com/ProfPaulPoast/status/1510230256673828864/photo/1

Paul Poast (@ProfPaulPoast): Notice in the passage that Huntington mentions "many people" are alarmed by the possibility of violent conflict between Russia and Ukraine.  Who are those "many people"?

Paul Poast (@ProfPaulPoast): A specific person he has in mind is -- unsurprising given current commentary on the war (ðŸ‘‡) -- John Mearsheimer.

Paul Poast (@ProfPaulPoast): The same year as Huntington's essay (1993), Mearsheimer published in @ForeignAffairs a piece on why Ukraine should keep nuclear weapons. Mearsheimer's argument was that they would be necessary to deter future Russian aggression.
https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/ukraine/1993-06-01/case-ukrainian-nuclear-deterrent

Paul Poast (@ProfPaulPoast): How do we know that Mearsheimer was Huntington's specific target?  Because Huntington says so in the book version of his argument.  Here is the key passage. https://twitter.com/ProfPaulPoast/status/1510230270699786246/photo/1

Paul Poast (@ProfPaulPoast): Huntington goes on to say that this could lead to a fracturing of the country, which itself might be violent.  But such a fracturing should not result in inter-state war with Russia. https://twitter.com/ProfPaulPoast/status/1510230277276069893/photo/1

Paul Poast (@ProfPaulPoast): From my vantage point, the Russia-Ukraine war is evidence in favor of Mearsheimer's earlier arguments (though not his most recent arguments; a point I made in an earlier ðŸ§µ)...
https://twitter.com/ProfPaulPoast/status/1500097922788175879

Paul Poast (@ProfPaulPoast): ...and is a crucial piece of evidence against Huntington's argument. 

This is something that others have highlighted, such as Oliver Roy...

Paul Poast (@ProfPaulPoast): ...& @mattyglesias in a recent post.
https://www.slowboring.com/p/ukraine-and-the-end-of-history?s=r

Paul Poast (@ProfPaulPoast): Even @DouthatNYT's recent piece acknowledges this shortcoming of Huntington's argument.
https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/30/opinion/ukraine-clash-of-civilizations.html

Paul Poast (@ProfPaulPoast): The truth is that Huntington's failed prediction regarding ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦-ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡º relations is just ANOTHER reason to be skeptical of the "Clash of Civilizations" thesis more generally.

Paul Poast (@ProfPaulPoast): Those reasons for skepticism range from strange "civilization" coding decisions by Huntington...
https://twitter.com/grudkev/status/1509157396341575687

Paul Poast (@ProfPaulPoast): ...to Huntington's own coding of civilizations not supporting his thesis...
https://twitter.com/ProfPaulPoast/status/1123959180220686341

Paul Poast (@ProfPaulPoast): ...difficulty even defining a "civilization" in the first place... https://twitter.com/ProfPaulPoast/status/1510232652011474952/photo/1

Paul Poast (@ProfPaulPoast): ...questions about the mechanisms of the theory...
https://twitter.com/GokhanBalaban8/status/1510001372372082688

Paul Poast (@ProfPaulPoast): ...and that Huntington may have had underlying alternative motivations.

https://twitter.com/Robert_E_Kelly/status/1509750965108297738

Paul Poast (@ProfPaulPoast): In sum, "Clash of Civilizations" is a widely known (and problematic) claim. Even Huntington himself would have to admit that the Ukraine-Russia war shows it to be wrong.

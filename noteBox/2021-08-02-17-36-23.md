Ewout ter Haar (@ewout): Well this is load of bollocks, isn't it? As if attributes of interest to physicists are directly visible to them. They are not! https://twitter.com/ewout/status/1422321097937199106/photo/1

You think physicists  "see" charge, or spin, or lengths, for that matter? No, they use instruments, just like psychologists do.

Instruments that mediate how the world presents itself, and also how we present ourself to the world. In other words, instruments that represent reality, but also affect it.

Balaji Srinivasan (@balajis): One of the most important coalitions forming is the alliance of civil libertarians and technological decentralists.

Balaji Srinivasan (@balajis): The progressive theory was that the media would defend free speech. Instead they advocated for censorship.

The libertarian theory was that tech companies would compete with each other in free markets. Instead they colluded to deplatform people.

This is driving decentralization.

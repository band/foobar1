Rabbi Danya Ruttenberg (@TheRaDR): We normalized the mass shooting of six and seven year-old children in 2012 and did nothing. 

We normalized the mass deaths of almost an entire generation of gay men and did nothing (until absolutely forced to.)

We have normalized a 500% increase in incarceration since 1970. https://twitter.com/steveubc/status/1488320167192903685

Rabbi Danya Ruttenberg (@TheRaDR): Our country’s horrific and dehumanized response to this pandemic is of a piece of so many other responses to so many things. From its two great founding sins (enslavement and genocide) on down. 

See the role of corporations. See the special interests at play. See it.

Rabbi Danya Ruttenberg (@TheRaDR): And now, in the anger, the exhaustion, all of it, say: 

What is is not what must be. 

Say it again. 

What is is not what must be.

Rabbi Danya Ruttenberg (@TheRaDR): We have made change here in this country in the past and we can make it again. 

The work is hard and agonizing and arduous and I know we’re all knee deep in hitting that third anniversary of this but what is is not what must be and we can be the difference in that.

Rabbi Danya Ruttenberg (@TheRaDR): The only way things are ever going to be different is if we make them different. 

If we say: enough dehumanization. 

Enough turning aside when people suffer. 

Enough prioritizing money over lives. 

Enough.

Rabbi Danya Ruttenberg (@TheRaDR): What is is not what must be. 

And we can bring in a vision for something better. 

More human. More whole. 

We can only do it together. 

In solidarity with one another. 

Hearing one another and caring for one another. 

The only way forward must include all of us.

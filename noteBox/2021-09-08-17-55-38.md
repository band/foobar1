Peter Kalmus (@ClimateHuman): There are three reasons I prioritize mitigation over adaptation. 

1. We will adapt to the extent we can. That's what we do. Adaptation needs little or no extra pushing. This isn't so with mitigation.

Peter Kalmus (@ClimateHuman): 2. Some of what's coming will be beyond our ability to adapt. The more we mitigate, the more we save.

Peter Kalmus (@ClimateHuman): 3. Adaptation will be astronomically expensive and therefore highly unequal. Poor people and the Global South will get the shaft. Mitigation helps everyone, including nonhumans.

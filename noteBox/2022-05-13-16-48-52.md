Andrew Dessler (@AndrewDessler): Playing around with GPT-3.  Pretty impressive.  I gave it the prompt: "Here are some examples of how climate change is harming humanity."  Response in green. https://twitter.com/AndrewDessler/status/1525164917724422145/photo/1

Andrew Dessler (@AndrewDessler): I have to say, it also nailed: "Here are some examples of how climate change is good for humanity."

"Climate change will lead to more extreme weather conditions, which will provide opportunities for adventure seekers and thrill seekers." https://twitter.com/AndrewDessler/status/1525165372407697410/photo/1

Dr. Genevieve Guenther (@DoctorVive): @AndrewDessler Aren't 1 and 4 false?

Andrew Dessler (@AndrewDessler): @DoctorVive when I said "it also nailed it," I was being sarcastic.  those are either wrong or terrible.

Dr. Genevieve Guenther (@DoctorVive): @AndrewDessler Indeed. Which is weird, because its answers to your first question were pretty good!

Zeke Hausfather (@hausfath): @DoctorVive @AndrewDessler For better or worse itâ€™s designed to build from your prompt, not to tell you that your prompt is wrongâ€¦

Andrew Dessler (@AndrewDessler): @hausfath @DoctorVive let's see what it says about you, Zeke: https://twitter.com/AndrewDessler/status/1525201889033330689/photo/1

Zeke Hausfather (@hausfath): @AndrewDessler @DoctorVive RIP greentech media where I never worked. But glad that the global warming conspiracy theory is so highly rated! ðŸ¤£

Andrew Dessler (@AndrewDessler): @hausfath @DoctorVive it clearly is designed to come up with "plausible" prose rather than prose that's actually correct.  nevertheless, this is going to be a seismic shift in education.

Zeke Hausfather (@hausfath): @AndrewDessler @DoctorVive It will even create semi-accurate citations at timesâ€¦

Dr. Genevieve Guenther (@DoctorVive): @hausfath @AndrewDessler 4/5 *based on 33 reviews* lol

# bandstands

A [Massive Wiki](https://massive.wiki/) housing Bill Anderson's (a.k.a. "band") past and current web and wiki experiments, assorted notes on readings, day-oriented journal and blog entries, and whatever else shows up. The repository name is shared with a now dormant Tumblr blog, some of whose entries are posted and maintained here.

- Journal-like notes
- Notes on readings
- [[Tumblr repostings]]
- Drawing board (for the startup ideas)
- Lab Bench (for experiments and system admin notes)

# bandstands

A [Massive Wiki](https://massive.wiki/) housing Bill Anderson's (a.k.a. "band") past and current web and wiki experiments, assorted notes on readings, day-oriented journal and blog entries, and whatever else shows up. The repository name is shared with a now dormant Tumblr blog, some of whose entries are posted and maintained here.

For now, use the "Search" and "All Pages" buttons at the top to find your way around.

**Comments welcome!** Click the "<" icon in the upper right to open the Hypothesis annotation/highlights panel.  Sign up or log into Hypothesis in that panel to add comments and annotations to the pages in this wiki.

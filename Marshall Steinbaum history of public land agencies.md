# Marshall Steinbaum history of public land agencies

Marshall Steinbaum 🔥 (@Econ_Marshall): Just listened to this great podcast ep from a few months back where ⁦@ErikLoomis⁩ interviews Andrew Sowards on the history of public land agencies. Recommended, especially if you want an informed historical take on “a liberalism that builds.” https://listen.stitcher.com/yvap/?c=sharelink&af_dp=stitcher://episode/203310203&af_web_dp=https://www.stitcher.com/episode/203310203&deep_link_value=stitcher://episode/203310203

Marshall Steinbaum 🔥 (@Econ_Marshall): *Adam Sowards, apologies.

Marshall Steinbaum 🔥 (@Econ_Marshall): The reaction against New Deal-era federal agencies developing the public lands was laws that enlarged the set of stakeholders consulted. That reflects the environmentalists’ eventual successful alliance with anti-New-Deal conservatives.

Marshall Steinbaum 🔥 (@Econ_Marshall): Everyone gets a say, meaning government does nothing. This is what destroyed the New Deal’s version of A Liberalism That Builds, but now we have the Hewlett-funded effort to revive the coalition that destroyed the ND by… abrogating labor & environmental standards?

Marshall Steinbaum 🔥 (@Econ_Marshall): It doesn’t make any sense, and it certainly won’t work. It’s the kind of thing that you’d come up with in a think tank conference room to “bring everyone together,” except, you know, actual people.

# 2022-03-02 remarks

1. Texas Independence Day - for what that's worth.
2. Re-reading Amitav Ghosh The Great Derangement surfaces the desire to reflect on the wholesale use of self-oriented virtues and the support of collective goods. Maybe even "achievement" is a tired idea.
3. Explore more of Ghosh's inquiry into the ideas of "moral" actions.

An aside on personal knowledge management:

I re-tagged and shuffled;
Added links here and there.
Some feathers got ruffled
The notes and pages didn't care.

1. One of today's technology mysteries presented itself in my Mac Mail client: an email sent to me this morning displayed a similar message from the same address sent to me three weeks ago.
    Saving the raw-text of the email to my Desktop and viewing it with Emacs showed a different message than the one displayed in Mac Mail.
	Even using the Mac Mail tools to show headers and raw-text displayed the older message; not the one sent and received today.
	So, riddle me that one, Batman.
2. Browsed the LYT Kit (https://publish.obsidian.md/lyt-kit/_Start+Here) website. It seems like useful information and advice, but overkill for me. Maybe I just do not want to get organized.

## The Ides of August

Sarah Chayes, August 15, 2021 

> I’ve been silent for a while. I’ve been silent about Afghanistan for longer. But too many things are going unsaid.

> I won’t try to evoke the emotions, somehow both swirling and yet leaden: the grief, the anger, the sense of futility. Instead, as so often before, I will use my mind to shield my heart. And in the process, perhaps help you make some sense of what has happened.

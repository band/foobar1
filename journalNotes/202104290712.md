This, from Twitter (https://twitter.com/HybridPed/status/1387738443183050752), is up for consideration:
Hybrid Pedagogy - @HybridPed: "The real work now lays ahead of us, it’s questioning the beliefs we have accepted, often without the realization that they are a part of us." A wonderful piece by @SuritaJhangiani. Please take the time to read!

Here is the full last paragraph:

## The Search for Reclamation

I cannot be silent any longer.  The real work now lays ahead of us, it’s questioning the beliefs we have accepted, often without the realization that they are a part of us. It’s questioning how we reproduce oppression and privilege. This involves deep critical introspection. What I am asking is not easy. We need to see our surroundings in a new light, with a critical eye for the ways in which the status quo is being subtly reproduced and how our actions feed into whiteness. Find your voice not just in the quiet moments, but when ripples will follow.

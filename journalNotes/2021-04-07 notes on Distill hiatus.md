# 2021-07-04 Notes on Distill hiatus

"Over the past five years, Distill has supported authors in publishing
artifacts that push beyond the traditional expectations of scientific
papers. From Gabriel Gohâ€™s interactive exposition of momentum, to an
ongoing collaboration exploring self-organizing systems, to a
community discussion of a highly debated paper, Distill has been a
venue for authors to experiment in scientific communication."

This explanation from the Distill editorial team on why they are
taking a hiatus from publication provides concise argument supporting
self-publication as the way forward in making research findings
accessible to all.

There is something gentle about the writing in this piece that seems
to transcend the written words.

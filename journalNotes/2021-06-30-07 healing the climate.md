# 2021-06-30-07 healing the climate

Dr. Elizabeth Sawin (@bethsawin): 
If you've been dreading and/or working against this moment of climate consequences hitting harder and harder for many years, what do you want people who are more recently attuned to climate change to know?

For me, it's a few simple things:
ðŸ«‚ Welcome, we need you, we've been waiting for you!
 - There's so much we can still do!!
 - We have a chance to heal the climate by creating a more just society!
 - We have a chance to create a more just society in how we try to heal the climate!

Tim Patterson (@TCPatterson):
@bethsawin There's no point where it makes sense to give up - every fraction of a degree of heating that we can prevent makes a difference, and is worth working for.

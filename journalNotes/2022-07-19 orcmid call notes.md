# 2022-07-19 orcmid call notes

Notes from today's buddy call with orcmid:

/ Dissatisfaction with messiness of life and social matters //   

/ Weird ideas about having large social things be done in a way that's not  large and social //  
/ Market discipline. Â Fixing our problems just with carbon capture.  

/ What the founders thought about and how they arrived at a social  democracy //  
/ For individuals participating in a social world //  
Focused on the  social welfare for everyone //

/  individualism - detached from participation in a social world //

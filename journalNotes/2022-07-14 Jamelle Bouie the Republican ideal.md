# 2022-07-14 Jamelle Bouie - the Republican ideal


> [The] Republican ideal of a “pro-family” agenda is girded on traditional hierarchies. Reproductive autonomy, up to and including the right to get an abortion, weakens hierarchies of gender. And the social safety net — especially one that extends directly to mothers and children — undermines the preferred conservative social order of isolated, atomized households kept in line through market discipline.

For me the key phrase is "the preferred conservative social order [is one] of isolated, atomized households kept in line through market discipline."

/ "market discipline" -- is this something like a law of nature? //  

When we give up the idea that that responsibility for our social and political arrangements lies somewhere other than with ourselves, then, perhaps, we can work towards providing for the general welfare of life on Earth.

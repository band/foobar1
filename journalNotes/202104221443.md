Still noodling about how to organize a personal, or Praxis101, massive wiki site. In addition to some kind of information organization (which always leaves some things un-classified), a way to publish the content to a web site is required. This last requirement has its own set of deployment questions, including (1) where is the site?, (2) how easy is the publishing?, (3) what are the minimal first steps?

### PeteKaminski's list of massive wiki basic properties:
	- it needs a "Home" and "All Pages" button
	- a corner banner pointing to the github source + issues
	- a link to the page history for each page
	-  nav breadcrumbs    
    -   representing hierarchy back to top
    -   the pages i've recently visited (implemented with javascript)

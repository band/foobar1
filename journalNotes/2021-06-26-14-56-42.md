Adding a journalNote using GitJournal.

Had to clone the repo here and let GJ create an SSH authorization key. I think.

 - next steps include adding to this note and maybe figuring out how to link to the early GJ notes?

[[create a link]] ?
[[alternate words for notes]]

- one problem observation: updates done outside of GitJournal and pushed to the repo do not seem to show up on the iPad.
- also access is given (via SSH key) to github.com/GitJournal which seems a little too open to me. I have not thought this through ....

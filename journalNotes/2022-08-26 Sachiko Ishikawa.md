Sachiko Ishikawa 💙💛 (@Ishikawa_Sachi): I am begging howaito people to stop this orientalist bs trend of taking common human concepts and mystifying them.

Yes, we say しょうがない. You may also have heard of its counterpart “oh well.” https://twitter.com/jamierusso/status/1562468751756255234

I was taught the language of Shakespeare’s descendants.

They have beautiful words and concepts such as “fuck off into the sun” which alude to the brilliance of the brightest star in our galaxy and bids the addressee to part and journey to the center of the solar system.

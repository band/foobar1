# 2021-05-25 - world of tropes

	I'm livin' in a world of tropes,
	Banalities, mottos, sayings, and aphorisms.
	A world of 'bon mots', wise sayings,
	Other remembrances from a past I never knew.
	
	But when Donna wrote
		"meanwhile
		past disappears into present
		into future
		indeed
		there is no present moment"
	
	I sat up straight.
	Grateful for seeing, listening,
	For this.
	Thank you.

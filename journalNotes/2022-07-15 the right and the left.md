# 2022-07-15 the right and the left


Synopses of the view from the right:

From [[2022-07-01 Prof Julia Steinberger climate and ecology crises thoughts]]  
... right-wing parties are sticking with expressed values of 'freedom' and 'riches for merit' and innovation/ingenuity as progress, and removal of public sphere obstacles to wealth accumulation, broadly. These positions fit with dominant narratives of neoliberalism, and long-term allegiance to ruling classes....


From [[2022-07-14 Jamelle Bouie the Republican ideal]]  
For me the key phrase is "the preferred conservative social order [is one] of isolated, atomized households kept in line through market discipline."

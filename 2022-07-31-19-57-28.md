Albert Pinto (@70sBachchan): Everyone please read Project Drawdown  https://drawdown.org/solutions/table-of-solutions
We need to weave many different climate solutions in this decade & all hands required on deck! ht @GlobalEcoGuy   https://globalecoguy.org/we-need-4-waves-of-climate-solutions-6e58adbc5ad6
1 Quick Wins
2 New Infrastructure
3 Growing Natural Sinks
4 Deploying New Tech https://twitter.com/KendraWrites/status/1424007220056965121

Albert Pinto (@70sBachchan): 2/ " “Quick Win” solutions focus on halting highly destructive practices, such as widespread deforestation, flaring and fugitive emissions of methane, and “black carbon” emissions from dirty cookstoves, biomass burning, and other sources" https://drawdown.org/solutions/table-of-solutions

Albert Pinto (@70sBachchan): 3/ There are obstacles to implementing all of these "Quick Win" solutions, of course, but they offer large and immediate emissions reductions, plus strong economic returns. They are among the lowest hanging fruits https://globalecoguy.org/we-need-4-waves-of-climate-solutions-6e58adbc5ad6

Albert Pinto (@70sBachchan): 4/ The core of world economy - US, EU & E Asia- are all investing trillions of dollars in New Infrastructure & machines that are green.

What’s the best time to get started? Answer: 30 years ago. 

What’s the second-best time to get started? 
Today.

Albert Pinto (@70sBachchan): 5/ Are climate pessimists & Doomers listening to these wise words? 
"We will be living with climate change forever. It is heavy as hell. But we must get used to it—and then figure out what to do next. 
And next. And next" -@alybatt  https://policytensor.com/2019/06/02/discourse-reality-and-strategy-in-the-planetary-impasse/ https://twitter.com/bethsawin/status/1423658624262590464 https://twitter.com/70sBachchan/status/1424421150558466055/photo/1

Albert Pinto (@70sBachchan): 6/ In the 21stC, ALL politics are climate politics.  
A must-read on what it takes to change fossil-fueled civilization https://adamtooze.substack.com/p/chartbook-newsletter-17
The energy transition will have to be won, community by community, across the world. https://twitter.com/70sBachchan/status/1394793379117080579

Albert Pinto (@70sBachchan): 7/ The Future is R.E.D says Intl Energy Agency. 
Reduce demand (#PrivateSufficiencyPublicLuxury,social change,less meat etc)
+
Electrify everything (transport+heat+manuf)
+ 
Decarbonize electricity (build out Renewables & Grid then shut 1000s of coal+gas) https://www.iea.org/reports/net-zero-by-2050 https://twitter.com/70sBachchan/status/1424424577871003655/photo/1

Albert Pinto (@70sBachchan): 8/ R.E.D is a 3 legged stool. R - Reduce - comes 1st & most important. Thread on what #PrivateSufficiencyPublicLuxury looks like in communities. They already exist and we will need to build many more of them to reduce amount of E- Electrification. https://twitter.com/70sBachchan/status/1062735330325889024

Albert Pinto (@70sBachchan): 9/ Favourite of the IPCC take explosion ! Climate change nihilism is becoming all too common just as the fossil fuel companies intended. We can stop burning carbon and build a new green civilization. 
We are a special generation. https://twitter.com/DavidPomerantz/status/1424715023809761284

Albert Pinto (@70sBachchan): 10/"You are only interested in solutions that will enable you to carry on like before...those answers dont exist any more. Avoiding climate brkdown will require CATHEDRAL thinking...lay the foundation while we may not know exactly how to build the ceiling" https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/apr/23/greta-thunberg-full-speech-to-mps-you-did-not-act-in-time

Albert Pinto (@70sBachchan): 11/ Excellent charts in report from International Energy Agency. Must-read if you are interested in Climate, Energy, Finance, development. IEA sets the agenda for world's investors and countries.

Albert Pinto (@70sBachchan): 12/ Ironically climate scientists were far more depressed in mid 2000s to mid 2010s than now. Because then,nobody in society or politics (to first order) was paying attention to mounting danger. More and more ppl getting alarmed now is reason to be hopeful https://twitter.com/robertjbennett/status/1455978304910106624

Albert Pinto (@70sBachchan): 13/ Are any legislatures going to attempt carbon pricing? Is the Govt going to nationalize fossil companies & drive 2-5 % GDP green investment? 
No. 
What's possible is a pragmatic sector-by-sector approach rather than any grand plan ht @adam_tooze #COP26

Albert Pinto (@70sBachchan): 14/ Much needed Gramscian level-headedness on Climate from two of the best political thinkers. We need every ounce of ingenuity, fox-like cunning and ALL hands on deck  ht @alybatt @GeoffPMann  https://www.newstatesman.com/ideas/2021/11/what-kind-of-crisis-is-the-climate-crisis

Albert Pinto (@70sBachchan): 15/"the scale and fractured nature of the climate crisis guarantees there will be no decisive end,no point when we can be certain of a path out of crisis with minimal tradeoffs. No governing system—authoritarian or democratic—can offer that" ht @jerometenk
https://bearistotle.substack.com/p/political-science-authoritarianism

Albert Pinto (@70sBachchan): 16/ Every country is investing billions of dollars in New Infrastructure & machines that don't burn carbon

Albert Pinto (@70sBachchan): 17/ IPCC WG3 solutions report has no room for false binaries:
Invest a ton more in already existing clean energy technologies AND in behavioral shifts  
AND Shut down existing fossil infra AND develop technology for hard-to-abate sectors we need in future

Albert Pinto (@70sBachchan): 19/ Smil's cold blast of energy materialism (has anyone been more laser focused on the 4 pillars of Fossil modernity - Steel, Cement, Fertilizers, Plastics?) is good http://vaclavsmil.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/JPM.2019.pdfhttps://twitter.com/jerometenk/status/1519769877472591875

But his NYT piece claims are wildly off. Nice fisking thread 
https://twitter.com/jerometenk/status/1519769877472591875

Albert Pinto (@70sBachchan): 20/ Good advice on avoiding doomers: Disengage IMMEDIATELY! Don't waste your time. There's nothing, I repeat NOTHING, you can do to convince the doomer"

Attempted rationally refuting Doomers in our essay here. : https://policytensor.com/2019/06/02/discourse-reality-and-strategy-in-the-planetary-impasse/ https://twitter.com/mahirilgaz/status/1552598001985650688

Asha Rangappa (@AshaRangappa_): Good post here by @emptywheel collating the various ways that the coup players and timelines have been depicted (feat. my coup chart along with visuals from @ValdisKrebs @WendySiegelman and @AriMelber), and the challenges in doing so https://www.emptywheel.net/2022/08/01/mapping-the-scenes-of-the-crimes/

Valdis Krebs ðŸŒ» (@ValdisKrebs): @AshaRangappa_ @emptywheel @WendySiegelman @AriMelber Thanks for including our network map from the televised #Jan6thHearings. We have been mapping "key event" networks, using public data, since 9-11. https://journals.uic.edu/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/941/863 https://twitter.com/ValdisKrebs/status/1554533926718394370/photo/1

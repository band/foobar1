Thanks Doug!

You are right, it is a challenging thing filled with contradictions yet, I think it might be possible to work toward coherence without control - a guiding principle of our work when I was on the development team at the World Cafe.

I recall reading a post by Humberto Maturana where he claimed that humans are essentially cooperative and collaborative - we had to be because the world was a dangerous place in which to raise children and so what got conserved (from a biological point of view) we behaviors that rewarded making the world safer to raise children up to be adults. However, he notes, at some point in our distant past we began to conserve pathological behaviors (probably around the time of the Ag Revolution when we got surpluses of food that led to settlements and storehouses of grain that needed guarding and the rise of nation-states etc.)

What would it look like if humans could shed these pathological behaviors and once again conserve behaviors that made the world a safe place in which to raise offspring to adulthood?

The worry is that waking up different populations and getting to coherence  contradict each other.

It's like we need a new kind of social science that can deal with leadership, hierarchy, the nature of groups, belief, myth, humanity past the dunbar number.  I like Bruno Latour’s  managing the critical zone, the narrow band of life and air that cover the earth at a thickness less that the skin on an apple and within which all known life in the universe is present. . Bt most social thinkers  imply that if we do better there will be no losers. This just might be impossible.  If so how to continue a public presence?

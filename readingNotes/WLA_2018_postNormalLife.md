# 2018 Post Normal Life

Stowe Boyd has been describing a "post-normal" world that we are creating and now inhabit. This world is a context for  "the future of work", another long-standing theme of his writings. A short synopsis of Stowe's views are in this [quote](https://www.workfutures.io/p/work-futures-daily-work-futures-dot-org)

Three articles have helped my thinking about Stowe's generative ideas.

The first is "The Presence of Totalitarian States-of-Mind in Institutions" by W. Gordon Lawrence, and published in 1996. The second is "The Return of the Repressed" by Wolfgang Streek, translated by Rodney Livingstone, and published in the New Left Review in 2017.

Lawrence  uses "psycho-analysis as a tool of cultural inquiry and crticism ... to see what is taking place at an unconscious level in all the groups and institutions in which we participate ...." In 2018 (and still true in 2022) the idea that "much of the stuff of the social arrangements human beings make to organise their social life is to defend themselves against psychotic anxieties" is not seen as valid or useful. Nonetheless, Lawrence provides a useful description of the properties (drivers?) of our current "uncertain environment", a phrase that fits with Stowe Boyd's views.

2022-03-28: Larry Hirschhorn's 2021 paper "Extending the Tavistock model: bringing desire, danger, dread, and excitement into a theory of organisational process" (Organisational & Social Dynamics 21(1) 114-133 (2021) - *behind a paywall*)) proposes that being explicit about "important emotions that shape how people take up their work and roles in organisations" can highlight "how organisations become functional, and work becomes satisfying."

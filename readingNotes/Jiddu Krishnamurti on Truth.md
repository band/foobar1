# Jiddu Krishnamurti on Truth
Note made on 2022-05-07

>The core of Krishnamurti’s teaching is contained in the statement he made in 1929 when he said, “Truth is a pathless land.” [A person] cannot come to it through any organization, through any creed, through any dogma, priest or ritual, not through any philosophical knowledge or psychological technique. [They have] to find it through the mirror of relationship, through the understanding of the contents of [their] own mind, through observation and not through intellectual analysis or introspective dissection.—J. Krishnamurti, _The Core of the Teachings_

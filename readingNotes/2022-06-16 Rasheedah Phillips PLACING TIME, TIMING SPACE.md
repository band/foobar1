**Questions to Consider When Encountering Maps & Clocks**

 - Who is the mapmaker or clockmaker?  
 - Who is the intended map/clock user?  
 - What is the purpose of the map or clock?  
 - What, if anything, on the map or clock is up for question?    
 - What is being taken for granted if and when you use the map?  
 - What temporal landscape does the map/clock embody? What year was it made? Does it still stand the test of time? What has changed? What has remained?  
 - Where are you in time when you are using the map or clock? What are the intersecting and conflicting temporalities are pulled into your NOW/present when using the map or clock?  
 - Imagine the boundaries and Contested Boundaries that the map or clock contains. How can they be remapped/redrawn/re-envisioned to be more equitable in time and space?  
 - What unspoken agreements, understandings, contracts, social constructs, and negotiations are embedded in the map or clock?

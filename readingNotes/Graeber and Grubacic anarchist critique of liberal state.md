### Some notes on the anarchist ("stateless socialism") critique of the liberal state.

1. The reigning political common sense. That is, how societies *must*
	be organized. Our current one is the liberal state.
	
2. Theories of social evolution (dominated the 19th Century and
	remain with us today)
	- human societies can be organized according to stages of
    development [an invented notion]
	- each stage has its own characteristic technologies and forms of
      organization
	- how much "freedom" and "equality" is consistent with an
      advanced commercial society based on a sophisticated
      division of labor
	- social evolution called "progress" early on
      - not just a matter of increasing complexity,
      differentiation, and integration
	  - but a kind of Hobbesian struggle for survival
	  - the phrase "survival of the fittest" coined in 1852 by
        Spencer to describe human history
	  - this ides taken up by market liberals to propound a
        "gladitorial view" of human history in which only the strong
        survive
		  
3. Anarchist critique of this liberal state
	- the rule of law is ultimately based on arbitrary violence
		(a secular version of an all-powerful God that can create
		morality because it stands outside of it)
	- the need for punitive law and the apparatus of the state is *not* because of a flaw in human nature
	- they (punitive law and the state) exist owing to the existence
      of the institutions of private property, and money
	- the existence of these institutions by their very nature
      drive people to act in ways that make coercive means necessary
	- equality is the condition for any meaningful freedom

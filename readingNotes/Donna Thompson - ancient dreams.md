[Donna Thomson]

	ancient dreams
	hover and disappear
	at the edge
	of memory
	growing older
	dreaming less
	night time
	dream time
	day time
	dissolve
	into each other
	night becomes
	the space
	that holds
	the day time dream
	suddenly
	i smile to remember
	she who struggled
	so hard to know what is real
	and what isnâ€™t
	oh Awareness
	that dreams itself
	continuously
	into Being

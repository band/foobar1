Perhaps because I am retired from full-time employment I am resistant to the focus on people cataloging their skills, passions, superpowers, etc. This seems to be one sure way for me to "raise shields" and proceed with caution.


1. Stop asking people "What is your superpower?" when they are new to a group or activity.
2. Ditto for the "What is your passion?" question. Especially in a job or work interview.

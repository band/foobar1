        <p>It's a pandemic!
So compose a haiku, and
Drink the cool water.</p>
<p>Yikes! A pandemic!
Sit with the anxiety,
And sip some hot tea.</p>
<p>It's trauma stacking.
Now we all have PTS.
And the sun still shines.</p>
<p>By the air we breathe
We are all connected now.
It's a pandemic!</p>

<p>Our conception of “work group” needs to be distinguished
from that of Bion. For Bion, the work group is that aspect of group
functioning which is not pervaded by basic assumption life. In his 
theory, the group is a work group only when it dedicates itself to the
real work for which it has met. When the group is unable or unwilling
to so dedicate itself, but instead acts on the basis of some
irrational assumption (e.g., dependency, pairing, fight-flight)
regarding its task, it is a “basic assumption” group. We, also,
distinguish the extent to which a group devotes itself to task work as
opposed to other concerns, including irrational ones. For us, however,
a work group is an aspect of social reality and, as such, cannot be
interpreted in and out of existence. It is always a work group no
matter how the group's efforts are divided between the pursuit of its
defined task and the pursuit of other aims.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:Note1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>

<li id="fn:Note3">
<p>Group dynamic theorists within the Tavistock tradition
(e.g., Bion, Menzies) have tended to view organization and social
structure as a defense against anxiety. Not only is such a reduction
of complex social phenomena to individual-psychological constructs
epistemologically problematic (cf. Durkheim), but also this specific
interpretation is often untrue even within its own frame of
reference. Using such a conceptualization, one often sees the reverse
-- the development of disorganization or chaos in part as a defense
against anxiety. Not infrequently (as in the present ward), a group or
its leadership may allow and even foster ambiguity and confusion
regarding the nature of the primary task in order to avoid what is
anticipated to be sharp, focused, and painful conflict.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:Note3" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:Note8">
<p>The distinction between position and role
(Levinson, 1959) is important here -- position refers to structure,
role to function. If one loses the idea of position and thinks
exclusively in terms of role, as many social scientists do, then the
examination of organization tends to overemphasize process, activity,
and function and to overlook the structural base from which
organizational activity proceeds. An occupant of one single position
may, and probably will, carry out numerous functions deriving from his
position; confusion ensues if one assumes that each function involves
a separate location in organizational space.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:Note8" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:Note7">
<p>There is no general consensus regarding the definition of the
concept of authority. Often, the terms authority and power are used
interchangeably. For us, there is an important difference between
these two notions which, if obscured, limits the analysis of social
systems. This difference rests upon the issue of legitimacy. Power
denotes sheer capacity and implies nothing about the right to possess
or use it. Whereas authority, by our definition, always involves some
degree of power, power need not involve authority at al! Thus, anyone
with a gun has power but, under the law, only the policeman ordinarily
has the authority --the legitimate right-- to use one. Authority
degenerates into power when its legitimate --legal or moral—- basis is
eroded or overreached (cf. Schaar's “Legitimacy in the Modern
State’). Katz and Kahn's treatment of authority (p. 220) as legitimate
power inherent in positions within the organization is consistent with
our meaning.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:Note7" title="Jump back to footnote 4 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>

<p>We do not regard this set of four constructs as
exhaustive. In working toward a comprehensive analytical framework, we
have started with these because we consider them of central
importance. Among the other constructs that need to be taken into
account in the study of groups and organizations are: material
resources, technology, demography (ie., the distribution of social and
psychological characteristics such as sex, age, race, and
work-relevant personality characteristics), and the like. An
additional construct of importance here is that of “career”; that is, 
the differential participation of individuals in the work of the group
and the organization ts determined to varying degrees by
considerations of career.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:Note12" title="Jump back to footnote 5 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>

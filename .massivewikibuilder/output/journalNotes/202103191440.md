When asked about what I value and interest on Catalist I replied:

“Kindness, curiosity, honesty, and humor. I am interested in learning about, examining, and promoting abundance-based models and ideas of sustainable human societies.”

I guess the first sentence can be "I strive to live with kindness, curiosity, honesty, and humor."

And the last sentence can be followed with "I am also committed to reviewing my early years first-order learnings about the world."

ruh-roh, getting high-falutin' now.

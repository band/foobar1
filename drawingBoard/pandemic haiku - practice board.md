    It's a pandemic!
    So compose a haiku, and
    Drink the cool water.

-----

    Yikes! A pandemic!
    Sit with the anxiety,
    And sip some hot tea.

-----

    It's trauma stacking.
    Now we all have PTS.
    And the sun still shines.

----

    By the air we breathe
    We are all connected now.
    It's a pandemic!
